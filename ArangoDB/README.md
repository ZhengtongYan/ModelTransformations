# ArangoDB

The file UploadData.txt contains three commands for uploading the three data sets into ArangoDB database.

Before executing the commands, you need to navigate to the folder that contains the executable file called arangoimport. Its location is something like C:\Program Files\ArangoDB3 versionNumber\usr\bin.

Fix the paths in the commands to point to the data sets. The commands automatically create document and edge collections.

After executing the commands, you can create a graph called "personKnowsPerson" in a browser and execute the queries in the file Queries.txt.
